# Siri_Project

This program is a simple voice assistant program that uses the speech_recognition, 
pyttsx3, pywhatkit, datetime, wikipedia, and pyjokes libraries to perform various tasks. 

The program can take voice commands as input, recognize them using the speech_recognition 
library, and then perform the appropriate action.

# Features

The program can recognize voice commands and perform various tasks such as playing a song, 
telling the time, searching Wikipedia for information on a person, searching the web, 
telling jokes, and more.

The program can speak the output using the pyttsx3 library.

# Requirements

To run this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed, as well as the following libraries:

`speech_recognition`
`pyttsx3`
`pywhatkit`
`wikipedia`
`pyjokes`

# Usage

To use the program, simply run the script and give a voice command such as "play a song" 
or "what is the time?". 

The program will recognize the command and perform the appropriate action.

# Limitations

The program is limited in its ability to recognize voice commands, and may not always correctly understand the user's intent.

# Conclusion

This program provides a simple example of how voice commands can be used to control a program. 

It can be useful in various applications like chatbots, voice assistants, and more. However, 
this program is not so sophisticated and it can be improved by using more sophisticated 
libraries and techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) for better understanding of user's intent.
